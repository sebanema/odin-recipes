<p><h2>Ingredients:</h2></p>

    <p><ul>
        <li>8 ounces pad thai rice noodles, preferably brown rice noodles</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons canola oil</li>
        <li>¾ pound lean ground beef</li>     
        <li>2 cups stringless snap peas</li>   
        <li>2 cups matchstick carrots</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped scallions</li>
        <li>½ cup pad thai sauce (see Tip)</li>
        <li>Chopped peanuts and lime wedges for serving</li>
    </ul></p>

<p><h2>Steps:</h2></p>

    <p><ol>
        <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook noodles in boiling water according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup cooking liquid and drain the noodles.</li>

        <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef, and cook, crumbling with a wooden spoon, until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Add snap peas, carrots and scallions, and cook, stirring often, until the peas are bright green, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        
        <li>Add sauce, the noodles and about half of the reserved cooking liquid; stir with tongs to coat. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer, adding more of the reserved cooking liquid to moisten if necessary and stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Serve hot with chopped peanuts and lime wedges.</li>
        
    </ol></p>

<p><h2>Tips:</h2></p>

    <p>Tip: Bottled pad thai sauce is high in both sodium and added sugar but try and find a brand with less than 560 mg of sodium per serving (like Thai Kitchen Pad Thai Sauce).</p>
